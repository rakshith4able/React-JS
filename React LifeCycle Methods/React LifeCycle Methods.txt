There are 3 react life cycle methods:
1)componentDidMount();
2)ComponentDidUpdate();
3)ComponentDidUnmount();

The normal flow of react is whenever we add a component to render 
1) First the control goes to Constructor
2) Second the controls goes to render()
3) Then React shows the component on the screen that means the component is now mounted.



1)componentDidMount()

- This is executed when after constructor() and render() but only once
- We place the fetching information code in this methods
- The code may be to fetch data from api or to set state of the component
- Even though setting state inside the constructor words it is not the best approach

2)componentDidUpdate()

-This is executed after mounting
- when state or props are changed the render is called again and after updating the content this is called 
-This method is used to have code that does some side effect operations like storing data to localstorage,
autosaving and updating DOM for uncontrolled components.

-This lifecycle method can take two parameters the first one will be used to get previous props (before updating)
and next one is previous states( before updating).

3)ComponentDidUnmount()

-This is executed when the component is removed.
-This may be used to clear resourses after the element is removed.

Forms

- HTML form elements  work differently than any other DOM elements in React
- Because they naturally have their own internal state
- Its convenient to have a JS function that
1) handles the submission of the form and
2) has access to the data the user entered
- This technique is called controlled component

Controlled component

- In HTML, form elements like <input>,<textarea> and <select> maintain their own state and 
update it based on user input.

- In react, mutable state is kept inside  the state of components and only updated using setState()

- We make the React  state be the "single source of truth"

- React controls
1)What is shown(Value of the component)
2)What happens when the user types(this gets kept in state)

-Input elements controlled in this way are called "controlled components"

Working of Controlled Forms:

1)Value attribute is set on element. Displayed value is always this.state.inputname 
2)on  every change in the control  handleChange runs and updates react state.

1)We dont specify handlers for multiple inputs as one for each

2)Instead we use computed property names.
i.e,

let microchip=143;
let catData={
[microchip]:"Blue Steele" //Same as 143:"Blue Steele" => [microchip] in object is converted into ints value
}

3)Using Computed property names we can use only one onChange handler for multiple inputs

4) We do this by including name attribute in inputs with value same as in state and set onChange of all 
methods to same handleChange method.

and add Computer property names in handleChange method

handleChange(evt)
{
     this.setState({[evt.target.name]:evt.target.value})
}

NOTE: In react forms the label tag should not use for attribute Instead should use htmlFor attribute

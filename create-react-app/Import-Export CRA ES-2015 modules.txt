Import-Export - is the way of sharing code,functions,objects,classes etc bw JS files

The syntax create react app uses is through ES2015 modules

//Consider a file has many functions say 3 for example.
1)helpful
2)sort
3)sing

1)If we want to export helpful by default . then

export default helpful;

To import that in another file we specify.

import anyname from './helpful';

//if we do not specify ./ and only specify name it checks for module with fiven name in node folder


2)If we want to export multiple things

export {helpful,sort,sing};

to import this

import {helpful,sort,sing} from './helpful';

3)If we want to import default export as well as specific methods exports

export default helpful;
export {sort,sing};

to import this

import helpful,{sort,sing} from './helpful';

1)There should be only one react component in one JS file.
 name of the file shold match the component name
//Our JS files goes in src folder//
Example 
1.src/Car.js for Car component
2.src/House.js for house Component

2)Components extends Component(imported from React)

3)Export each components as default object.
so we import Component from react in each Component JS file as

import React,{Component} from 'react';

4)Skeleton assumes  top object is App in App.js
best to keep this

5)CSS files for each component should be named as componentName.css
 and the root div element should have className="ComponentName"
and further element class should follow the convention os componentName-classname.

We import CSS by 
import './filename.css';

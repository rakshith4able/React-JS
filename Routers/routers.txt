- Routers are used for client side routing.

- i.e, changing the content(components to display ) in page without actually refreshing the page.

- We can achieve the same outcome by using  conditionals and render the component we need. But
thats not feasible approach. the pages cant have their own link we cannot track history of pages and so on

- Routers are not built in to react. But there are many packages available to use routers.

- We will use react-router-dom

1)Installing react-router-dom

npm install react-router-dom

2)Go to index.js and import {browserRouter} from react-router-dom

3)Go to app.css import {Switch,Route,Link,NavLink} from 'react-router-dom'

<Switch>
<Route path="/" component={Component_name/>}/>
<route path="/abc" render={()=>{<Component_name props=value />}}/>
</Switch>

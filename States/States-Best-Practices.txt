//Minimizing state

1)We should include as less data possible in state.

2)If something will never change, then do not include in state.

3)If we can derive something from existing props or state then do not include that in state.

//Designing state as downward dataflow

1) Parents should be more stateful than children

2)It will make easy for debugging. Because the state is centralised. Its easier to predict where to find state.
- Is the current component stateless? Find out what is rendering it. There's the state.

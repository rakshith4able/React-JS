- State is something that constantly changes in response to events

- 2 types of things that states can track of:

1)UI Logic- The changing state of interface. Eg. There is a modal open right now because I am editing my profile.

2)Business Logic- The changing state of data . Eg. In inbox the message is read or unread and this affects how they are displayed.

- State is internal data specific to the component and that data changes over time.

- State is an instance attribute on a component

- State should be initialized as soon as the component is created. So we set it in constructor function. 

class ClickCount extends Component{
    constructor(props){
        super(props);
        this.state={
            //values you want to track
            numClicks:0 //start at 0 clicks
        };
    }
}
